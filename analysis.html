						Overall most participants felt that before using the mouse it would take them about a week to
						bring their confidence levels of using the ergonomic mouse up to their confidence of using a
						normal mouse. One participant felt that they could accomplish this in only a few hours while
						another felt that it would take the best part of a month for them to learn. Most participants
						did not change their opinion on the matter after completing the tasks assigned to them however a
						couple did feel that they could upskill in a shorter amount of time.

						We found that connecting the dots (task one) was the task that users were least confident in.
						The participants were slightly more confident when tasked to move folders and files over (task
						two) than the first task. Finding the scroll button and using it (task 3) was the task that
						users felt most confident performing. The participants had more confidence doing simpler tasks
						involving less precision of movement. The increased difficulty of the task reflected the
						participants confidence with moving the mouse. Moving the mouse more freely meant it was easier
						for the participant to achieve the task with more confidence.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the participants felt they were confident when using the ergonomic mouse to accomplish
						the different tasks. However one participant showed that they were less confident than normal.
						The natural feel and positioning of the buttons had caused discomfort. Both the negative effects
						influenced how confident the participant was in being able to achieve the tasks.

						This graph shows how long that participants thought that they'd be able to use an ergonomic
						mouse in one sitting. As you can see in the graph, after using the ergonomic mouse for roughly
						30 minutes the participants average was about 6 hours. After 6 hours participants believed that
						their wrist or arm would start feeling pain. This is fairly long compared to a normal mouse as
						on average people using a normal mouse would start to feel pain in a couple of hours.
