					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>
						Computers are always equipped with a mouse to allow us to to interact with the device. Even
						though we use computer shortcuts and the trackpad in our laptop the mouse always serves a
						essential purpose in completing tasks. As university students we use the regular mouse almost
						everyday. We have culturally mapped to the regular optical mouse as we have grown up our lives
						with it. Although, the regular mouse serves the purpose to navigate and interact with our
						computer the ergonomic mouse is proven to be capable to do tasks that a regular mouse does.
					</p>
					<p>
						In recent years, the ergonomic mouse has been rising in demand for several purposes for its
						functionalities, design, health purposes and comfort to the hand. The focus of this research is
						to find out out if users will prefer to use a ergonomic mouse than a normal mouse for completing
						tasks on a computer.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are focusing on the preferences of the user when using an ergonomic mouse to research what
						the user's perspective on the ergonomic mouse to be able to perform a task.

					<h4>Developing the Hypothesis</h4>
					<p>
						Our interactive device for our HCI assignment 2 is the 3M ergonomic mouse, that we will
						investigate as a team. Prior to research we developed a hypothesis that we wanted to test:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							We hypothesise that the design of the ergonomic mouse will cause less strain on the wrist
							because of the arm muscle placement and position
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially we considered experimenting with measuring the stress on the arm and comparing the
						ergonomic mouse and a regular mouse. We thought about looking into both the comfort and
						discomfort and muscle placement position while using a mouse. It is proven that a regular mouse
						to have given arm fatigue, wrist and even carpal tunnel syndrome to users in the long term.
						However due to limited available resources we couldn't obtain the equipment to measure these
						factors within the time frame given for our experiment.
					</p>
					<p>
						To mitigate this we developed another hypothesis: We hypothesise that users will prefer to use a
						ergonomic mouse rather than a normal mouse for completing tasks on a computer.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's why we have chosen to study the 3M ergonomic mouse.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have decided to experiment with the participants and then to undertake a questionnaire. Each
						task we have asked participants to do involves movement, clicking and positioning of the
						ergonomic mouse. These factors should provide the participant with enough information to make
						informed opinions of the ergonomic mouse. This will hopefully prove our theory that users will
						prefer to use a ergonomic mouse rather than a normal mouse for completing tasks on a computer.
