					<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
					<p>We hypothesise that users will prefer to use a ergonomic mouse rather than a normal mouse for
						completing tasks on a computer.</p>

					<h4>Experiment Methodology</h4>
					<p>
						We carried out this experiment by setting users activities to do in a laptop that involved the
						use of the ergonomic mouse. The tasks were determined in 3 key areas of accuracy, high-level and
						low level precision and control. We also included some common skills that is done when using
						regular mouse that is opening a file, saving a file and scroll down a webpage.
					</p>
					<p>
						We prepared for this experiment, by first setting out the tasks. These tasks involved connect
						the dots, draw a picture in MS paint, save and scroll using the ergonomic mouse. We also
						designed a set of questions to ask the user while using the mouse and carrying out the tasks to
						get their opinions and perspectives.
					</p>

					<h4>Subjects</h4>
					<p>
						The subjects used in this experiment were all university students either from Auckland
						University of Technology or University of Auckland.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col s10 offset-s1">
					<h4>Materials/Location</h4>
					<p>
						All experiments using a 3M ergonomic mouse were conducted in the same environment which was
						located in the HCI lab. Constantly conducting it in the same place ensures that each individual
						will have the same surrounding, ensuring that the participants views won’t be altered by the
						surroundings.
					</p>
					<p>
						To ensure that the participants conditions were the same, we ensured that they used the same 3M
						mouse, the same laptop, the same tasks and the same table.
					</p>

					<h4>Tasks for participant to complete</h4>
					<p>
						Firstly users were asked to read the form and sign the participation form to inform them what
						was going on and the processes involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						Participants were then directed to a seat where they were to do the experiment. Firstly they
						were given time to get used to the mouse, during this time they weren’t told how the mouse
						worked or what the buttons on the mouse did. We asked the participants their views on the mouse
						and once they were comfortable to continue, a team member directed the participant with each
						task.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first task involved a simple connect the dots with a cat, then after that a harder spongebob
						one. The second task required them to move files from one directory with another only using the
						mouse. Finally the last task was to locate the scrolling button.

					<h4>Data Collection</h4>
					<p>
						Data was collected in a questionnaire form involving scales 1 - 10 to ask how they felt about
						each task using the 3M ergonomic mouse. Each task had also been timed to see how long each
						participant would take.

					<h4>Overall Feedback</h4>
					<p>
						We interviewed 10 students both male and female about their usability with the 3M ergonomic
						mouse. Most of these students use the regular mouse on a daily purposes to communicate with the
						computer. We had two user who use keyboard shortcuts and the trackpad more than the regular
						mouse.
					</p>
					<p>
						The overall feedback consisted a mixed review with more than 75% haven’t used an ergonomic mouse
						before. Their initial impressions of the design of the 3M ergonomic mouse was it looked like a
						joystick or a device used for gaming purposes.
