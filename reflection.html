						This was a different experience for me as I have never conducted an HCI experiment before,
						however it reminded me of my physics experiments back in high school because of all the
						different types of variable in the experiment (independent, dependant, constant). From my point
						of view, I struggled a little bit with the experiment because I found that as a team we couldn't
						think of many tasks for the user to do on the ergonomic mouse. This led to a delay in starting
						our experiments which slowed down the team production/output. However, once we had the data, I
						found that we analysed it fast and managed to get some useful data. This fast analysis was due
						to our team having high cohesion with each other. As a team I felt that our strong points were
						the fact that we didn't argue with each other and that we respected each others ideas, even
						though we thought that that idea was wrong, we listened and talked about it as a team. Due to
						that I strongly feel that I would gladly work with this team for other group projects. I also
						struggled with time management because I had many things due like the R&D project, Web
						Development Assignment 2 and Software Engineering. This made it difficult to balance the work I
						needed to do for this assignment.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the experiment my role was to guide the participants into the room, explain to them what
						was going to happen and to guide them through each task. I found this to be an enjoyable
						experience but also difficult because I had to act in the same way and talk the same way to keep
						the experiment "the same" for every participant. I also did some research into how to run an HCI
						experiment and tried to plan our experiment based on those findings. These findings helped the
						team structure the experiment well and to ask the right questions to get the data that I needed

						I have learnt much from working on this assignment. While I initially felt interested in the
						paper, as we went through the paper my enjoyment of it decreased. While being aware of how
						people interact with technology is important, I do not believe that I could do this type of
						assignment again. This assignment while I did participate and provide relevant input I believe
						that we had much to improve on. I did not take an active role during the experiments I spent
						that time recording the participants responses to questions, I felt that I could not spend time
						doing the research but instead being aware of it from the perspective of a developer which is
						more relevant to my Computer Science and Software Development majors.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was able to help my team to finalise parts of our assignment while providing valuable feedback
						to each member so that they can complete their work to the best of their ability. I did also
						find myself critiquing most of how we did this assignment as we often found ourselves changing
						how we were experimenting or presenting the data.
					</p>
					<p>
						I found this assignment also quite confusing in the sense that we could not as a group determine
						what type of research we were doing. I know I was not alone in my confusion as most of my group
						did not understand what our methodology was and I think that our research took longer to be
						finished due to this uncertainty. I also think that due to this as a group we did not perform
						our experiments very consistently thereby having a negative impact on our results. I am sure
						that with further learning on my behalf I could have assisted my team in better performing
						during the assignment.
